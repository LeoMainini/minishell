most builtins only execute if not before pipe so only last builtin in chain needs to execute
List of builtins that execute before pipe:
    export with no args
    env
    echo
    pwd
All builtins create a outfile with their data even if they dont execute or write
none of builtins read from stdin
save write data of builtins to .temp_b_out file for pipex to execute as infile
while cmds not builtins add to pipex arguments
save output to .temp_s_out and check remaining pipes
if remaining pipes means its a builtin and output can be discarded
repeat until no more pipes
ERRORS ARENT WRITTEN TO FILE BUT TO STDOUT SEPARATELY ON ERROR CASE
exit
