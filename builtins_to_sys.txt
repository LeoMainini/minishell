builtins only execute if not before pipe so only last builtin in chain needs to execute
none of builtins read from stdin
save write data of builtins to .temp_b_out file for pipex to execute as infile
while cmds not builtins add to pipex arguments
save output to .temp_s_out and check remaining pipes
if remaining pipes means its a builtin and output can be discarded
repeat until no more pipes
exit
